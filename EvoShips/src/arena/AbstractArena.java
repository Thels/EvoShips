 * Class that will hold the shared behaviour between the various arena types. 
 * 
 * Since each arena can implement it's own rules and such, the only thing that will differ from
 * most arenas to one another is when to calculate the arena has ended.
 * 
 * This class is observeable, since if the arena is being displayed, then it will be required 
 * to update its observer every tick.
 * 
 * Each arena is threaded, so that we can run multiple arenas at once later on down the line concurrently.
